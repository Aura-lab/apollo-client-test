# apollo-client-test

Thank you for giving me the chance to show my code to you. 
Regrettably, Typescrip is more concise than Javascript, I still use JS this time as I am accustomed to use it.
Furthermore, regarding of the test of subscription, I did not test for it as I think it will neeed more environment 
to support and I am not sure whether I can get a callback before the test finish or not.Mock also can not be used this 
time and there is no call return to me.
