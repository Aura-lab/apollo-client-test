# apollo-client-test



Thank you for giving me the chance to show my code to you. 
Regarding of the test of subscription, I did not test for it as I think it will neeed more environment 
to support and I am not sure whether I can get a callback before the test finish or not.Mock also can not be used this 
time and there is no call return to me.

Cheers
